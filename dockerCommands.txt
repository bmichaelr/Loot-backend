(for more info on dockerfile or compose see -> https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)

Very basic docker commands:

If using compose file: (WE ARE SO USE THESE COMMANDS)

    Build an image and run it on a new container (add -d flag at the end to run in background)
    $ docker compose up --build

    Stop a currently running image
    $ docker compose down

If not using compose file:

    Build image:
    $ docker build -t <name of image> .

    Run an image:
    $ docker run <name of image>

    Stop and image:
    $ docker stop <name of container>

Images:

    See all images:
    $ docker images

    Remove an image:
    $ docker rmi <image name>

Containers:

    See running containers:
    $ docker ps

    See all containers (running and stopped):
    $ docker ps -a

    Stop a running container:
    $ docker stop <container id or name>

    Remove a container:
    $ docker rm <container id or name>

AWS:

    Not a docker command, but this is the tool to push the new image to the container in lightsail
    $ aws lightsail push-container-image --region <Region> --service-name <ContainerServiceName> --label \
    <ContainerImageLabel> --image <LocalContainerImageName>:<ImageTag>

    Breakdown:
        <Region> is the name of the region the container lives in (e.g. us-west-2)
        <ContainerServiceName> is the name of the container in AWS
        <ContainerImageLabel> can also be the name of the container in AWS
        <LocalContainerImageName> the name of the image on your LOCAL computer that you want to push (see commands above to list all images)
        <ImageTag> is the tag for the image you are pushing, normally use 'latest', but run docker images and check the tag to be safe
